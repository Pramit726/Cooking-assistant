1.  Fluff up the flour, then measure correctly.
2.  In a bowl, mix flour, milk powder, and baking soda. Sieve or mix uniformly.
3.  Add 1 tsp ghee/oil to the mixture and mix well.
4.  In a small bowl, mix lemon juice/yogurt with 2 tbsp milk.
5.  Pour 1.5 tbsp of this liquid mixture into the flour mixture.
6.  Gently bring the flour together to form a smooth dough. Add more milk/curd mixture sparingly if the dough is too dry, using only as needed. The dough will be sticky at first.
7.  Grease your fingers and make a ball with the dough. The dough should hold shape well and be smooth without cracks.

1.  Divide the dough into 14 to 18 equal-sized portions.
2.  Grease your hands and roll each portion into smooth balls. Ensure they are free of cracks, as cracks will appear on the fried gulab jamuns. Keep the balls covered.
3.  Heat ghee or oil in a pan on medium heat.
4.  Check syrup: Ensure it is hot but not boiling.
5.  **Test Oil Temperature:** Drop a small piece of dough into the oil. It should rise slowly without changing color. If it rises rapidly and browns, the oil is too hot; let it cool slightly.
6.  When the ghee/oil is medium hot, add the balls. Do not overcrowd.
7.  Fry the balls on a medium flame for 1-2 minutes, then reduce flame to low and continue frying until golden brown. Stir gently and continuously to ensure uniform frying.
